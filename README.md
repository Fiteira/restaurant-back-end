project to register restaurant orders

This project consists of developing a web application for managing orders in a physical restaurant. 
The application allows employees to register orders directly at the tables. 
These orders are automatically transmitted to the kitchen, where the staff can view them in real-time. 
The application aims to improve the restaurant's operational efficiency by eliminating the use of paper for taking orders, streamlining communication among the team, and providing statistics about the most ordered dishes, etc. 
With this solution, the goal is to provide quality service and a pleasant experience for customers while making work easier for the staff.
